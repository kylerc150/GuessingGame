# GuessingGame
This is a guessing game project out of an old Python book. I decided to work on it and do more than instructed.

<hr>

You will need:
 * import random
 * import sys

This is because we use the random for random values in our guessing game, we then use sys to have us exit out of the program (kill the program)

This old Python book had a guessing game project in it and at first, I wasn't going to add it to Github but I thought I should show how I code/comment.

The book asked for something minimal and easy at first then asked for more in a later chapter. I then did what the book wanted and added even more.

There are screenshots to show what the output of it is and code to look at and analyze.
